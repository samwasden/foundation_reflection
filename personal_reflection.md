SAM WASDEN FOUNDATIONS REFLECTION


-- How has your knowledge of the tech field changed since class began?

Absolutely, I think one of the most challenging parts of learning to code is learning what the expectations are. You can find recourses on thousands of different ideas, languages, projects, etc, but it can be really hard to figure out what you really need to enter the work force, what skills and concepts companies are looking for and the different paths you can take to achieve your goals. I think as far as tech knowledge that I didn't have before that is some of the most valuable that I have recieved.


-- What was the most difficult part of Foundations for you? And how did you overcome that?

The most difficult part for me was really getting to understand the interaction between the front end, the back end, and any databases and 3rd party apis. Over the few weeks that we covered these topics my understanding increaces drastically and even after that period I was able to continue to learn and understand more as we continued to build out projects. I think just putting my head down and doing all the projects helped me the most, I encountered bugs and errors that helped me figure out what was happening under the hood and what I didn't understand before became clearer all the time.


-- Did you learn anything about the way you learn? What was it?

I think as far as my individual learning goes I was somewhat reinforced in my mindset that I just need to do the work. It may take hours or even days but if I can work my way through a project and see how all the little pieces interact and become necessary. I can lock that knowledge in my brain and store it much better than if I were just listening to lectures or copying down notes. The interactive lectures were some of my favorite parts of the class because I could see how what we were learning could be applied and brainstorm the ways that I could use that.


-- How will you apply what you know about your learning style during Specializations?

I need to keep grinding, I need to keep creating projects, especially projects that emphasize different skills and abilities that I may not be as strong in. I need to make sure to accomplish any assignments or projects feeling at the end that I know exactly what I did and why I did it. If a concept we are learning is challenging to me I may need to make up my own projects on top in order to gain a larger understanding of what is going on.


-- What was your experience with pair programming like?

Largely positive, I do find that I love putting my headphones in and programming by myself but I also am not sure it is the most efficiant. I really love teaching my peers as well when I may grasp a concept quicker or easier than they might. It reinforces the knowledge in my head as well as any other technique and in that sense Pair programming is incredibly effective for me. It could be challenging sometimes to work with the students that are working from home as it was often more difficult to explain or ask for assistance but for the most part it was not an issue and I ususally felt like we were equally invested in the work as well which was helpful.


-- What parts of Foundations did you enjoy the most? (This could be anything from a specific lab or lecture to the general setup of class or a funny moment.)

At the end of the day I just really loved coming in each day knowing that I would be coding for at least 3-4 hours that day. That I would be coding alone, as a class, or in a pair. It was just fun to be working on a common goal and learning new things, things that would often open doors to new projects or ideas. I just like making stuff and making stuff work.
